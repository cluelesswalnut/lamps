# About The Project

Client and server code needed to setup personal friendship lamps.

The friendship lamps use a Raspberry PI connected to LEDs for light and changing colors.
The lamps have a touch sensor used to turn the lamps on. The color can only be changed from a separate mobile app.

Currently the server is running on a Heroku instance.
